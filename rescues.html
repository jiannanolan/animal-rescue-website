            <p class="text-center push-1-2">The Alligator Snapper is being considered for inclusion on the endangered/threatened species list, so there is a study currently being done in Mississippi to trap and track our Alligator Snapping Turtle populations. The researchers set out humane traps for these large turtles and then get blood and tissue samples, weight and length measurements, etc. In one of these traps they found Fluffy, a young male snapper who had at some point been pierced with a trot line hook.  Many fishermen who find turtles on their lines will simply cut the line away, but leave the hook in the turtle's mouth.  This can be dangerous to the turtle for many reasons - the hook can migrate down the esophagus causing tears and the injury by the hook can cause swelling and pain, resulting in a turtle that can't eat.  Fluffy was brought to us, where our vet sedated him and removed the large hook from his mouth.  A few weeks later, he was released in the exact area where he had been trapped.</p>

          <p class="text-center push-1-2">We usually deal with native turtles, but with all the difference species of turtle and tortoise in the pet trade, we sometimes also get sick and injured exotic turtles and tortoises as well.  Such is the case with Brooke.  Brooke is a Sulcata Tortoise (also called the Spurred Tortoise).  Sulcatas are native to Africa and are the third largest tortoise in the world.  They are experts at escape, either by digging out of their enclosures or simply knocking down their fences. And, sadly, many people who buy this species as pets have no idea how large they will one day get, and many of them simply turn them loose when they become too much to handle.  We'll likely never know which scenario found Brooke in the middle of the road that day, but it ended with her being hit by a car. The damage was major, but Brooke is a fighter.  She's still with us, and likely will be for several years. She still has trouble using her back legs, and while that's not too much of a problem today, it very well might be in a few years when she weighs upwards of 70-100 pounds. So, she'll be with us until we can determine how her future weight will affect her mobility. She will eventually be placed for adoption.</p>

            <p class="text-center push-1-2">Echo came to us on July 2, 2017, after having an  unfortunate run-in with a weed-eater.  The people who found Echo didn't know we exist, and couldn't find anyone else to help him.  They did the best they could for several days, before finally finding our rescue. By the time Echo got to us, his wounds were badly infected, flies had laid eggs all over his frail body, and he was on death's door. By the next morning, he was gone. This led me to post on Facebook about his story, begging people to share our page so that no other turtle would have to wait for treatment like Echo did.  Little did I know how this one post would change our lives. Within two days, we had 5,000 new Facebook followers, the post had been shared 11, 454 times, and it had been seen by 898,458 people!! Life after that got a little crazy.  We had more calls and more injured turtles to help than we'd ever had before. But we made some of the best connections, the most endearing friends, and we were able to help almost 140 turtles that year. Never underestimate the power of Facebook and the love of humankind for animals.</p>
