                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>Our primary goal is to connect people who have found injured or orphaned wild animals with those who can look after them and get them back into the wilds. Through a network of rehabilitators (government word for people who help wild animals) and wildlife rescue centres across Ontario we try to save as may wild animals as possible.</p>
                <p>The first 24 to 48 hours after a wild animal is found is the most critical. They usually have been without food or water for a while and are confused and afraid. Connecting with a wildlife professional quickly can save their life. Use this site to locate a wildlife rescue centre in your area or a centre that specializes in a particular species </p>
